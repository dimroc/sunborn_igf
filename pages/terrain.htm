The terrain is implemented as tiles inside a standard Quad Tree with view frustum culling. Each tile has a precomputed triangle strip also known as a 'chunk'.
Across the whole terrain there are only 3 index buffers used for all tiles, representing the 3 levels of detail.<br>

<br>
<br>
  Gaps between tiles because of different levels of details are filled with 'skirts'.<br>

<br>
With the use of vertex shaders, we 'Geomorph' the tiles between the different level of details by interpolating between a lower
  detail position to a higher detail position. Distant mountains retain a suitable level of detail since we check the 'screen space error' metric.<br>

Texture splatting is featured through the use of shaders and a blend map. This Blend Map uses it's ARGB components to dictate the
amount a texture is used to determine a pixel's color.<br>

The load limit of our terrain renderer is determined by the computer's RAM. Please note that these textures are not final.
