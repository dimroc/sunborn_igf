The lighting and shading for our clouds is covered in the sky dome section.<br>
<br>
<br>
Our clouds take after Niniane Wang's <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20040114/wang_01.shtml" target="_blank">Gamasutra article</a> and 
are represented as a cluster of sprites with our textures adding the detail to the cloud type.
We chose this over the use of voxels because we felt it would be less taxing on the CPU. We do not, however, use the octagonal ring around the player 
because we do not intend to render characters to impostors and wish to see them moving between the clouds.<br>

We place importance on our clouds because we intend to have the player in the air for the majority of his gaming experience, and
desire a proper in cloud experience.<br>

A combination of sprites can represent a variety of cloud types.<br>

We utilize <a href="http://www.markmark.net/" target="_blank">Mark Harris</a>' Impostors for our clouds and our foliage (esp. trees). This is where we render the object to a texture,
and use that texture on a viewpoint-oriented billboard for a larger degree of movement.<br>
