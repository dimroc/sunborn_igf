ASCAP award winner Adam Waite recently commented on Adam's rock orchestra piece, Otis.<br>
<br>
<div style="position:relative; left:40px; width: 400;"> "Gilbert's skills and 
        talents go well beyond that of today's rock musician; his self penned 
        orchestra arrangement to his song 'Otis' shows a complete understanding 
        of the ensemble. Very few rock groups have been able to achieve what Mr. 
        Gilbert has done here; with his arrangement and composition of 'Otis' 
        he joins the elite company of greats such as The moody Blues and Bjork."
