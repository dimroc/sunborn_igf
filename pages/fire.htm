Our fire, the base for all future particle effects, uses point sprites on top of our particle simulation. Each sprite is 
individually animated with a 'video' sequence of fire.
<br>

<br>
<br>
A few issues we have faced is the painful creation of textures from videos of fire and the inability to rotate point sprites.
The point sprite rotation will be addressed by rotating the texture, not the sprite, on the pixel shader. The textures we'll just have to struggle through.
<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for the improved flame to come soon.
